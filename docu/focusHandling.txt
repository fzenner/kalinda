The focus events defined in this specification occur in a set order relative to one another. The following is the typical sequence of events when a focus is shifted between elements (this order assumes that no element is initially focused):

> User shifts focus
> 1.    focusin Sent before first target element receives focus
> 2.    focus   Sent after first target element receives focus 
> User shifts focus
> 3.    focusout    Sent before first target element loses focus
> 4.    focusin Sent before second target element receives focus
> 5.    blur    Sent after first target element loses focus
> 6.    focus   Sent after second target element receives focus
